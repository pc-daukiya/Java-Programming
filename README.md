# Java Practice Programs

This project contains a collection of simple Java programs designed for practice and learning basic programming concepts. Each program demonstrates fundamental Java programming techniques such as input/output, loops, conditionals, and basic algorithms.

## Included Programs

- Addition: Adds two numbers input by the user.
- Fibonacci: Prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.
- GradeChecker: Checks and prints grades based on input marks.
- Greatest: Finds the greatest of given numbers.
- helloworld: Prints "Hello, World!".
- KthOddNumber: Finds the k-th odd number.
- MultiplyComplexNumber: Multiplies complex numbers.
- OddEven: Checks if a number is odd or even.
- PrimeSeries: Prints prime numbers in a series.
- SecondLargestNumber: Finds the second largest number.
- StarSquare: Prints a square pattern of stars.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Java version 8 or above is recommended.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory containing the `.java` files.
3. Compile a Java program using the `javac` command. For example, to compile `Addition.java`:

   ```
   javac Addition.java
   ```

4. Run the compiled program using the `java` command. For example, to run the `Addition` program:

   ```
   java Addition
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts for input.

## Notes

- Each program is independent and can be compiled and run separately.
- The programs use standard input/output for interaction.
